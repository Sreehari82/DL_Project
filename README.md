# Home
This project aims to develop a robust classifier capable of distinguishing between real and AI-generated portrait images. The classification model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is evaluated on a dataset containing real and AI-generated portraits.
# Insights
The dataset used for training and evaluation is self-created and consists of portrait images, with labels indicating whether the image is real or AI-generated. The dataset was built by:

- Collecting Images: Gathering a diverse set of real and AI-generated portraits.
- Preprocessing: Normalizing and resizing images for consistency.
- Data Augmentation: Applying techniques to increase the dataset's variability and improve model robustness.
- Dataset Split: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets for effective model evaluation.

The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and includes the following components:

- Convolutional Layers: To extract features from images.
- Pooling Layers: To reduce dimensionality and retain important features.
- Fully Connected Layers: To make final predictions.
- Activation Functions: Such as ReLU and Softmax to introduce non-linearity and output probabilities.
